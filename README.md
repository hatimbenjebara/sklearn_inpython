# sklearn_in_python
Sklearn or scikit-learn is a popular open-source machine learning library for python.
Sklearn contain a variety of machine learning algorithms and tools for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, as well as tools for data pre-processing and model selection and tools for evaluating and optimizing machine learning models, such as cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection.
Some of the algorithms and techniques available in scikit-learn: 
•	Linear regression
•	Logistic regression 
•	Decision trees 
•	Random forests 
•	Supports vector machines (SVMs)
•	K-neares neighbors(KNN)
•	K-means clustering 
•	Principal component analysis(PCA)
•	Feature selection and pre-processing techniques
